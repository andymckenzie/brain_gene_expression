# Update August 2019

This GitHub repository was not referenced in the article "Brain Cell Type Specific Gene Expression and Co-expression Network Architectures" because it is not associated with the article. It was used in the creation of a separate shiny app that is not the same one as was presented in the article. This code was merely meant to be a record of the code for the separate shiny app.
